Paths to folders that store: snippets for OCR (extractedImagePath), images that are published via socket (extractedChartPaths), screenshots of analysed image with analysis results superimposed (extractedValidationPath), CSV logfile (csvOutputPath).
extractedImagePath = extracted
extractedChartPath = charts
extractedValidationPath = validation
csvOutputPath = output

Paths to files that are required for the software to run: config file that defines information to be extracted (analyzerConfig), image or video of screen to be analysed for debug purposes (sampleImagePath), https certificate (httpsCertPath)
analyzerConfig = config_v01.xml
sampleImagePath = debug/blank.png

Configuration of the software: screenshots with superimposed results (validationEnabled), read data from file instead of from capture card (debugEnabled), create CSV logfile (logEnabled), write all analysis results to console (consoleOutputEnabled)
validationEnabled = false
debugEnabled = photo
logEnabled = false
consoleOutputEnabled = false

Configuration of capture device: Device number and resolution
captureDeviceNumber = 0
captureImageWidth = 1366
captureImageHeight = 768

Configuration of extra data: file that contains static JSON data
urlExtra = test
extraConfig = test_extra.xml
